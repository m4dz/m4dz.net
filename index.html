      <h1>Dear and enjoyed visitor, <b>I'm <abbr title="Previously known as MAD's Graphics">M4D'z</abbr></b> <em>and this is my magic worldâ€¦</em></h1>
    </header>

    <p>The Web is our Far-West, and all of us are its Cow-boys. You can consider me as a Jessie James : fighting to build a better and safer place to all its users. More pioniers than colons, we just put in place the rails and leave to the next the opportunities to build the cities.</p>
    <p>So I do a lot of work to make huge interfaces with my tiny hands. I live in Normandy (FR), work in Paris and run through the web.</p>

    <p>I <a href="https://github.com/madsgraphics">write code</a>, <a href="http://talks.madsgraphics.com">give tech talks</a>, and sometimes <a href="http://shots.madsgraphics.com">take photos</a>.</p>
    <p>I also reasonnabily (less than often) scribble about my loves and hates in my <a href="blog.madsgraphics.com">Notes</a>.</p>
