  <h2 id="talks-articles-open-source">Talks, Articles & Open Source</h2>
  <p>I love to share my knowledge in many ways, especially in conferences. I spoke in various sessions, such as Paris Web, SudWeb, BlendWebMix, Kiwipartÿ, TakeOff Conf… My talks are available <a href="https://github.com/m4dz/talks/tree/gh-pages">online</a>, and mainly speak about quality, JavaScript, frameworks, accessibility and cryptography.</p>
  <p>I also write articles in my <a href="https://github.com/m4dz/m4dzblog">notes</a> and for some other platforms, like <a href="http://openweb.eu.org/">OpenWeb group</a> and the <a href="http://fr.clever-age.com/veille/blog/">Clever Age blog</a>.</p>
  <p>I collaborate on various OSS projects, like Brunch.io, Oh-My-ZSH, BrowserSync and others. I also wrote JS polyfills like <code>SVGEventListener</code>.</p>
  <p>I wouldn't be <em>mad</em> if I didn't have another cool project, so I'm currently writing a book called <em>Browser as a platform: unleash the power of strong webapps</em>. It tries to give a solution to the huge and unmaintainable large codebases, especially when you work with multiple developers, across distributed teams. I hope the book can be one day finished.</p>
